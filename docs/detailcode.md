```python
import random

# Number of piles
num_piles = 9

# Number of tokens in each pile
tokens_per_pile = 21000000

# Communicate randomly between piles
for pile in range(num_piles):
    for other_pile in range(num_piles):
        if pile != other_pile:
            communication_tokens = random.randint(1, tokens_per_pile)
            print(f"Pile {pile + 1} communicates {communication_tokens} tokens to Pile {other_pile + 1}")




** In mathematical notation, you can represent the concept of 9 piles of 21,000,000 tokens communicating with each other randomly as follows:**

Let \( P_i \) represent the \( i \)-th pile, where \( i \) ranges from 1 to 9. Each pile contains \( 21,000,000 \) tokens.

To represent random communication between piles, you might use a matrix \( M \) where \( M_{i, j} \) represents the number of tokens communicated from pile \( P_i \) to pile \( P_j \). Since the communication is random, you can use a random variable \( X_{i, j} \) to denote the number of tokens communicated.

So, in mathematical notation:

\[ M_{i, j} = X_{i, j} \]

where \( X_{i, j} \) is a random variable representing the number of tokens communicated from pile \( P_i \) to pile \( P_j \).
