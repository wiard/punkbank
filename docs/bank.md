# The punkbank.bitmap Chronicle

In the story of the Metaverse, we seem to envision with each other, the first things developers do is creating 3D all immersive enviroments. This is a concept that is kind of told by big players as Facebook. A Metverse to meet other people and, of coarse, sell each other advertisements. A digital landscape known as the **.Bitmap Meteverse** has since its blockout immerged as something like what already exists on the Ethereum Blockchain and needs to be explored further than just the obvious.
That is why I come up with Semantic Reasoning on Bitcoin Data. As we tahe Non-Arbitrary Data as the concept of the Built on Bitcoin concept of Bitoshi Blockamoto, the originator of this vision.
This reasoning on available data of Bitcoin gives us opportunity to experiment with the already existing model of the Semantic Web, but now in a smaller context and with exchange of value combined. As the ALL Immersive Web of Blockchain is often postulated as a Transaction Network, based on Blockchain Technology.

To be able to be successful though the Bitmap Theory needs its Parcels to create wealth. Parcels are the Transactions on the Bitcoin so its not that unexpected to consifer these same Parcels to be the Value Boxes of Bitmap Economy.
But there is no Economy?!

The Economies built on Bitcoin are very much around settings where a coin is involved and what I want to do is create tokens that enable people to exchange goods and services with eachother without being dependent of one Token or one Indexer. Thats why i deployed a token for every parcel within the Matrix. Ecery token can be used in vertical economies that have to be developed on the fly. And exchanged with other vertical economies considered certain rules that need to be understood beforehand.

Artificial Technology is the technology to tackle. It needs to be experimented with in a secured way. To do research on the possibilities to combine it from the start with a Truthmachine as the Bitcoin.
The Artificial Intelligence Technology can be used on endless ideas but we need to consider very small usecases. Just to be sure that we understand what we do and that we go outside the usual box of in game earning and all that what people do right now.

Semantic reasoning is part nof this whole idea. So I have created and inscribed programming like code snippets on Ordinals to show these snippets in relationship with the use cases on the 3x3 experimentation we are doing here.
With a Matrix of 3x3 Parcels on Bitmap and denominating them with specific numbers to start with is a simple use case, a simple setting with endless but not infinite possibilities. And this is important. We cannot cover the whole web, we can just try specific ideas and see how they attract others. 

The Semantic Reasoning is simplified with these code snippets. Just like the bigger Semantic Web has ways to describe relationships between objects and actions. Semantic Reasoning implies also logical reasoning and I believe Logic is the one technology that will withstand thousands of years of development. Words and the Logic attaced to this.

The real usecase of a Bitcoin needs to be combined with Artificial Intelligence to be really innovative. emerges as the canvas upon which a complex tapestry of interconnected elements unfolds. At its core are intricate **bitmaps**, visual representations meticulously mirroring the very blocks of the Bitcoin blockchain. These graphical depictions serve as a window into the underlying structure, a testament to the symbiotic relationship between the digital and physical worlds.

Within this metaverse, individual units of data take form as **parcels**. Among them, a significant entity is the **.bitocoin** parcel, embodying the essence of Bitcoin's digital currency. Yet, these parcels transcend mere representation—they are conduits of semantic reasoning. The analysis of transactions, execution of smart contracts, evaluation of stablecoin stability, security assessments, and environmental impact considerations all find a home within the semantic depths of these digital parcels.

Another crucial component comes to light in the form of **.element**, intricately interwoven with **.scripts**. Here, the metaverse's scripting capabilities unfold, reflecting the essence of Bitcoin transactions. The semantic reasoning embedded in these scripts extends its reach, enabling the execution of smart contracts and fostering cross-metaverse integration. A concept known as **reasoning** further empowers the metaverse, facilitating logical analysis on parcels.

In the grand tapestry of the .blockamotometaverse, these elements harmonize, each contributing to semantic reasoning in unique dimensions. Financial transactions find expression alongside logical analysis, and the metaverse itself becomes a stage for cross-dimensional integration—a digital symphony composed of bitmaps, parcels, .element, .scripts, and the profound capabilities of reasoning.
