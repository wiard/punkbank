# Unraveling the Complexity: How Parcels on Bitmap could leverage offchain calculations like BitVM

- [In case you want to go HOME: the BASE drums](../README.md)

The Bitmap concept and its Parcels are a viable approach to build a multifunctonal Metaverse upon. Except that its lacking the notion of a realm outside Bitmap. The Outside-of-Bitmap existence needs to exist to exert powers on Bitmap like, functional reasoning. Because it's so new, the concept, we cannot take it for granted and we take the liberty to continually work on this idea.

## The Bitmap Landscape built within a Matrix, representing 3 x 3 Parcels.

At its core, a bitmap is a compact representation of data using binary values. In the context of Bitcoin, a bitmap serves as a mirror reflecting the essence of a block. Inside almost every bitmap it is possible to imagine a 3x3 grid of numbers, each acting as a key to unlock specific data within a Bitcoin block or referring to any outside of Bitcoin data:

| 4 | 8 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 1 | 7 |
| 9 | 3 | 6 |

**Use Case: Index Reference of Elements**
- Each row represents a Bitmap's score in various subjects.
- Each column represents a specific subject.
- The matrix aids in evaluating and comparing Bitmap performance.
