# Unraveling the Complexity: How Parcels on Bitmap could leverage any calculation. Be it on or off-chain.

- [In case you want to go HOME: the BASE page](../README.md)

AS the future of the Metaverse is our children, I have developed a method for young people to reason upon while learning how economies work. We have a Matrix and within this Matric are 3x3 Parcels. Each Parcel is represented by a number and this number is deployed as BRC20 token. Each token has 21.000.000 in total and is to be minted on  [Unisat](https://unisat.io) per 1000.

## The Bitmap Landscape built within a Matrix, representing 3 x 3 Parcels.

At its core, a Matrix is a compact representation of data having placeholders of numbers ranging from 1-9. Inside almost every Bitmap it is possible to imagine a 3x3 grid of numbers, each acting as a key to unlock specific data within a Bitcoin block or referring to any outside of Bitcoin data:

| 4 | 8 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 1 | 7 |
| 9 | 3 | 6 |

**Use Case: Index Reference of Elements**
- Each row represents a Bitmap's score in various subjects.
- Each column represents a specific subject.
- The matrix aids in calculating, evaluating, weighing and comparing any type of data.
