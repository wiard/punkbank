# Unraveling the Complexity: How Parcels on Bitmap could leverage offchain calculations like BitVM

- [In case you want to go HOME: the BASE drums](../README.md)

Parcels become the points of value that can be reasoned upon. By adding the .element of NAT theory it is now possible to have any treshold referred to from a small collection of ordered numbers. The concept of Matrices is introduced because it speaks to people as a word and as a mean to play with. Children love numbers and our future public is the young blood that is going to enter the Metvaerse built on Bitcoin. So that is where we start.

## The Bitmap Landscape built within a Matrix, representing 3 x 3 Parcels.

At its core, a bitmap is a compact representation of data using binary values. In the context of Bitcoin, a bitmap serves as a mirror reflecting the essence of a block. Inside almost every bitmap it is possible to imagine a 3x3 grid of numbers, each acting as a key to unlock specific data within a Bitcoin block or referring to any outside of Bitcoin data:

| 4 | 8 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 1 | 7 |
| 9 | 3 | 6 |

**Use Case: Index Reference of Elements**
- Each row represents a Bitmap's score in various subjects.
- Each column represents a specific subject.
- The matrix aids in evaluating and comparing Bitmap performance.
