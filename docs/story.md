# How Parcels on Bitmap could leverage any Topic of Value to Humanity. Be it ON or OFF-CHAIN.

- [In case you want to go HOME: the BASE page](../README.md)

As the future of the Metaverse is our children, I have developed a method for young people to reason upon while learning how economies work. We have a Matrix and within this Matric are 3x3 Parcels. Each Parcel is represented by a number and this number is deployed as BRC20 token. Each token has 21.000.000 in total and is to be minted on  [Unisat](https://unisat.io) per 1000.

## The Bitmap Landscape built within a Matrix, representing 3 x 3 Parcels.

The Matrix is a nice way to represent numbers. Each number has endless possibilities but can you imagine what types of possibilities there are when numbers are combined? The individual number can refer to one topic or one good. Two numbers can do a calculation. Many number together can do very complicated things. Thats what I am trying here. Look at this example underneath. Tese are 9 random numbers in one Matrix.

| 4 | 8 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 1 | 7 |
| 9 | 3 | 6 |

**Use Case: Index Reference of Elements**
- Each row represents a Bitmap's score in various subjects.
- Each column represents a specific subject.
- The matrix aids in calculating, evaluating, weighing and comparing any type of data.

  **Summary**

At its core, a Matrix is a compact representation of data having placeholders of numbers ranging from 1-9. Inside almost every Bitmap it is possible to imagine a 3x3 grid of numbers, each acting as a key to unlock specific data within a Bitcoin block or referring to any outside of Bitcoin data:
