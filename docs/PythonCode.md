By using triple backticks (\`\`\`) and specifying the language (in this case, "python"), you create a code block that will display your Python code underneath each other in a GitHub README.

Make sure to replace the comments and code with your own content as needed.

```python
# Make a matrix of 3x3
matrix = [[None, None, None], [None, None, None], [None, None, None]]

# Add projects to the matrix
matrix[0][0] = "Project 1"
matrix[0][1] = "Project 2"
matrix[0][2] = "Project 3"
matrix[1][0] = "Project 4"
matrix[1][1] = "Project 5"
matrix[1][2] = "Project 6"
matrix[2][0] = "Project 7"
matrix[2][1] = "Project 8"
matrix[2][2] = "Project 9"

# Show the matrix
