# ECH Token Roadmap

The simple roadmap for ECH token is outlined below:

**Stage 1 (December 2023 - January 2024):**
- Exploring inscriptions in Bitmap
- Discovering Parceling on Bitmap
- Making a Matrix on Bitmap
- Combining several Bitmaps in One Matrix

**Stage 2 (January - February 2024):**
- Having a wallet attached to the website
- Having 9 different input fields on the website
- Acting upon Bitmap through the $ECH token
- Creating new Matrices with the $ECH browser

**Stage 3 (February - April 2024):**
- Adding the .element from @theblockrunner to the ECH protocol
- Using Names and Numbers to combine parcels of Bitmap
- Using Names and Numbers to explore Reasoning on the Content
- Showing the POWER of Reasoning on Bitmap and using NATs

# Bitcoin Ordinals Interface Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for developing an interface for interacting with Bitcoin Ordinals. We explore two primary approaches: a web-based interface accessible through browsers and a direct interaction interface that operates on the Bitcoin blockchain. Our goal is to assess the usability, security, and user experience of each option to inform our development process.

  - [Phase 3: Usability and Security Testing](#phase-3-usability-and-security-testing)
  - [Phase 4: Launch and Iteration](#phase-4-launch-and-iteration)

## Web-Based Interface

### Pros

- **Accessibility:** Available from any device with a browser and internet, no special software required.
- **User-Friendly:** Intuitive GUI that lowers the barrier to entry.
- **Updates and Maintenance:** Server-side updates improve the user experience without requiring client-side software updates.
- **Centralized Management:** Simplifies analytics, support, and user account management.

### Cons

- **Internet Dependence:** Requires a stable internet connection.
- **Security Risks:** More exposed to online threats and requires trust in the platform's security.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Potential data collection by central servers unless strong protections are in place.

## Direct Interaction Interface

### Pros

- **Decentralization:** Aligns with Bitcoin's decentralized nature, avoiding reliance on central servers.
- **Enhanced Security:** Transactions can be signed locally, reducing interception risks.
- **Offline Functionality:** Some features may be available offline, enhancing usability.

### Cons

- **User Complexity:** Higher technical knowledge required, limiting accessibility.
- **Software Installation:** May require users to install specific software.
- **Maintenance Responsibility:** Users must keep their software updated, posing security risks if neglected.

## Hybrid Approach

A hybrid model could leverage the advantages of both systems, offering a web interface for accessibility and a downloadable client for secure, direct interactions.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research and Development

Explore technical and user experience requirements, developing prototypes to gather early feedback.

### Phase 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Develop an MVP based on phase 1 feedback, choosing the most suitable approach (web, direct, or hybrid).

### Phase 3: Usability and Security Testing

Conduct thorough testing to refine the interface, focusing on user-friendliness and security enhancements.

### Phase 4: Launch and Iteration

Release the chosen solution, continuing to iterate based on user feedback and the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem.

Our roadmap is designed to be flexible, adapting to new insights and technological developments. We are committed to creating a secure, accessible, and user-friendly interface for interacting with Bitcoin Ordinals.
