# Umeko's World: A Tale of Parcels on Bitmaps reasoned upon with NATs


With the introduction of NATs proposed by BlockRunner, confusion has arisen in the Bitmap Metaverse World. Simultaneously, Mempools of Ordinals on Bitcoin are becoming congested. Both of these events are concerning for the ecosystems built on Bitcoin for several reasons. Firstly, there has been a division in the Bitmaps Ecosystem due to the way BlockRunner has marketed its new Metaverse Concept as something different from the Bitmap Metaverse. Secondly, the roles played by indexers in both Metaverses have become too vital for participants to anticipate an independent and free metaverse in the long run.

We, Umeko, as a Brand on the Metaverse that is embodied by a Theory that employs ALL MATTER, we propose a solution that is simpler in all aspects.

The first proposals concerns the NAT theory that has very complicated ways of inscribing and therefor not user friendly as a way to enter a free Metaverse for all. 
We have earlier seen that an initiative like Sats Names had developed an easy to understand method to give names to person, objects, elements in the Metaverse. This is the method we propose as well in this way: NATs by the BlockRunner proposes .element as the basic element of their Metaverse and thats what we agree with as well but we want to inscribe it on Sats Names instead of inscribing it in JSON format, which is for developers and not for users that want comprehensible access to the Metaverse.

Than, with Bitmaps, we have acknowledged, its highly successful as it is right now. It is widely accepted as a way to build a Metaverse for the long term. The only substance it was lacking is an element that's higher than bitmap itself because we need to be able to reason outside of its existence to empower certain aspects, like reasoning on it's characteristics. 

The happy consequences of this simplification and combination of NAT's Theory and the Bitoshi Blockamoto Theory on Bitmap is that it's easy readible for everyone and thus easier to enter for everyone. Even for indexing it will be more efficient to have it off-chain and thus prevent further clogging off the Bitcoin Mempool as it is now.

What we propose now is visible in the pictures above and we work on it continually.

# Umeko's Metaverse Proposal Summary

The advent of NATs by the BlockRunner has stirred confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World. Simultaneously, Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are clogging, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Umeko, embodying a Metaverse theory employing ALL MATTER, offers a simpler solution.

1. **NATs Simplification:**
   - Rejecting complex NAT inscriptions.
   - Advocating the Sats Names initiative for user-friendly Metaverse entry.

2. **Bitmap Enhancement:**
   - Acknowledging Bitmaps' success.
   - Introducing a higher element, ".element," for advanced reasoning, inscribed in Sats Names.

3. **Simplified Integration:**
   - Improving readability and accessibility for all users.
   - Off-chain implementation to enhance efficiency and prevent Bitcoin Mempool congestion.
