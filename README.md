# Umeko's World💍: A Tale of Parcels💎 on Bitmaps🔶💎🔶 and deeper exploration of the Virtual Frontier🔷💍💎💍🔷 (Have you heard of Miss Oshi-b @Oshibitch lately?)

Very early in the morning, in a Tokyo subway, ☕☕☕☕☕ Umeko stood pressed between people, with a smoking coffee in her hand. She tried to sip it and enjoy it while it was still hot. Looking forward to go to her new job she thought of all the new challenges she was gong to face. The specific technology ☕☕️ she was going to bring to this very young startup, situated in the center of this overpopulated city ☕☕☕, pumping to stay aboard in this wild world of people, countries, continents racing ☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️ for their perceived survival. Umeko smiled. She knew she had the solution for everything this world needs. She feels confident about her ideas.

*Umeko, a young woman from Japan, envisions a promising future intricately woven with the threads of Bitmaps. In her world, Bitmaps serve as a symbolic representation of the virtual realm, securely anchored on the unyielding Bitcoin rails. Within this expansive digital landscape, Umeko perceives Bitmaps as open spaces, with Parcels on the Bitmaps embodying intrinsic value. These Parcels, mirroring transactions on the Bitcoin network, become the building blocks of a new frontier.*



She enters the building😊, which looks more or less like an old shop, but with nothing on the shelves🤣, and tries to let her eyes adjust to the relative darkness in the room she has entered. She hears steps coming closer and straightens herself up to meet the person. 'Hello there! You are Umeko!' A friendly young man in dark clothes and hair that is a bit too long😂 greets her. 'You are the girl who knows how to turn our bitmaps into gold! Fresh from university! We are so thrilled😏 to have you in our midst!'"

# 3. Developing Usecases on Disputes Resolution with Bitmaps

<img width="179" alt="Scherm­afbeelding 2023-11-22 om 08 45 03" src="https://github.com/wiard/Umeko/assets/900114/767f7fe4-c08c-4ad8-b34e-ce9cb42b8fd2">

In this guide, we'll explore how to develop use cases for resolving disputes between people using Bitmaps. The concept involves individuals putting their stake on a Bitmap by placing collateral money on parcels owned within a community. This community rents these parcels and receives rewards for the disputes that are 'fought out' on Bitmaps. The core idea is to use collateral to demonstrate commitment to a case, and once resolved, the invested money is used to compensate the algorithm that provided the solution.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Bitmap Stake and Collateral:

- **Bitmaps as Dispute Arenas:**
  Individuals stake their claim on Bitmaps, turning them into virtual arenas for dispute resolution.

- **Collateral on Parcels:**
  Collateral money is placed on specific parcels within the Bitmap. This serves as a commitment to actively participate in dispute resolution.

### 2. Community Rental and Rewards:

- **Parcels Owned by Community:**
  The community owns and rents parcels on the Bitmap. These become the battlegrounds for disputes.

- **Rewards for Dispute Resolution:**
  The community receives rewards for successfully resolving disputes on the Bitmap. This creates an incentive for active participation.

### 3. Algorithmic Solution and Compensation:

- **Algorithmic Dispute Resolution:**
  Disputes are 'fought out' on Bitmaps through algorithmic solutions, leveraging the collective intelligence of the community.

- **Compensation from Staked Collateral:**
  Once a dispute is resolved, the money staked as collateral is used to compensate the algorithm that contributed to the solution. This aligns incentives and rewards effective dispute resolution.

## Development Steps:

1. **Define Dispute Scenarios:**
   Identify the types of disputes that can be resolved using Bitmaps. Consider real-world cases where algorithmic solutions can provide value.

2. **Bitmap Staking Mechanism:**
   Establish a mechanism for individuals to stake their claim on Bitmaps. This could involve a smart contract that manages the collateral.

3. **Community Parcel Ownership:**
   Implement a system where the community owns and rents parcels on the Bitmap. Define the criteria for parcel ownership and rental rewards.

4. **Algorithmic Dispute Resolution:**
   Develop algorithms or leverage existing solutions for dispute resolution. Ensure transparency and fairness in the resolution process.

5. **Compensation Mechanism:**
   Create a mechanism to automatically compensate the algorithm that contributed to resolving a dispute. Define how the staked collateral is distributed.

6. **Testing and Iteration:**
   Test the system with simulated disputes and iterate based on feedback. Ensure that the incentive structure aligns with effective dispute resolution.

## Conclusion:

Developing use cases for disputes resolution with Bitmaps involves a combination of stakeholder engagement, community incentives, and algorithmic solutions. This approach not only provides a unique mechanism for resolving conflicts but also fosters community collaboration and innovation.
