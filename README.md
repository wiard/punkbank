### What is ECH

ECH started as a token-based project to do a few things. First, have a simpler approach on Bitmap-parceling. Second: have an incentive to create Matrices. Three: develop Matrices that have usecases.

### The usecases of ECH Matrices

Unifying parcels on Bitmap and having all kinds of usecases coming from there.


### Why the token

Once a project has a token people feel inclined to look for usability and my ECH project is to encourage people to work together on different usecases on Bitcoin.

### The parceling and the 3 x 3 Matrix of ECH

As Bitmaps is a nice project that people easily understand the idea of parceling was to create further functionality on Bitmaps. After several proposals in the Bitmap Discourd I realized people are not on the same page as far as Bitmaps is concerned, so I decided to develop my own implementation of how to reason with parcels on Bitmap.

### The original reason

Reasoning on Bitmap seems interesting but the true idea is to create a wider consensus on what Bitcoin as a development layer could mean for us normal people. A simple way to share ideas and topics that are of long term interest. Not so much the art or the financial aspects of it but the enjoyment of adressing many more topics, like decision taking and even simple gambling or playing.

### The Journey

As ECH was launched at the hight of the Ordinals and BRC20 fungible craze, the price climbed very fast and even I forgot to mint myself as the 21 million tokens were minted out in just a few hours on Unisat.

### The learning

Being not a programmer myself but having studied Information Sciences on University I have the capacity and the urge to understand whats happening in the space and therefor I want to develop ECH further. I even think it can become very popular and widely acknowledged as a project with its heart in the right place because I am not interested in hyping the wrong ideas as anyone can read from my X-space. For that reason I consider my efforts as BRC20Punk as the same as what I do at home on my computer to imnprove the incentives of using ECH in the near future I hope.

### The future

Studying crypto has becomne much more fun since Casey Rodarmor created Ordinals and I follow everything on a daily base, as one can very will see on X. I see X as a very good platform to share ideasm, by te way. Just like Casey Rodarmor I believe in the free mind and the free will of people. I am not as fatalistic as I think he is.

### The Marketing of Ordinals

There are some projects I really like on X and those are HellMoney Podcast in particular. For the rest I follow the larger movements and try to stay out of the clashes on X about what project is the best. Why do I like Hellmoney Podcast so much? I think because of the sincerity of it.

### Aiming for harmony

We should all aim for working together, despite our believes and differences in the space. As an artist originally, I believe we are all on the same page as human beings and in Crypto we hacve finally a ground to do better than those that we perceive as governing us. I say on purpose 'percieve' as them being our leaders, because I believe we are free people whenver and whatever we do.
