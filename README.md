### What is ECH

ECH started as a token-based project to do a few things. First, have a simpler approach on Bitmap-parceling. Second: have an incentive to create Matrices. Three: develop Matrices that have usecases.

### The usecases of ECH Matrices

Unifying parcels on Bitmap and having all kinds of usecases coming from there. How? By coding directly on Bitcoin one can mimic parceling.


### Why the token

Once a project has a token people feel inclined to look for usability and my ECH project is to encourage people to work together on different usecases on Bitcoin.

### The parceling and the 3 x 3 Matrix of ECH

As Bitmaps is a nice project that people easily understand the idea of parceling was to create further functionality on Bitmaps. After several proposals in the Bitmap Discourd I realized people are not on the same page as far as Bitmaps is concerned, so I decided to develop my own implementation of how to reason with parcels on Bitmap.

### The original vision

Reasoning on Bitmap seems interesting but the true idea is to create a wider consensus on what Bitcoin as a development layer could mean for us normal people. A simple way to share ideas and topics that are of long term interest. Not so much the art or the financial aspects of it but the enjoyment of addressing many more topics, like decision taking and even simple gambling or playing.

### The Journey

As ECH was launched at the height of the Ordinals and BRC20 fungible token craze, the price climbed very fast and even I forgot to mint myself because all minted out in a few hours on Unisat while I was away from my computer.

### The learning

Being not a programmer myself but having studied Information Sciences on University I have the capacity and the urge to understand whats happening in the space and therefor I want to develop ECH further. I think it can become accepted and acknowledged as a project because it brings new and fresh ideas in the space. I consider my efforts as BRC20Punk on X as the same as what I do at home on my computer to improve the incentives of using ECH in the near future.

### The future

Studying crypto has become much more fun since Casey Rodarmor created Ordinals and I follow everything on a daily base on X. I see X as a very good platform to share ideas and I like Casey Rodarmor for his free mind.

### The Marketing of Ordinals

There are some projects I really like on X. For the rest I follow the larger movements and try to stay out of the clashes on X about what project is the best.

### Aiming for harmony

My believe is we should all aim for working together, despite our differences in the space. As human beings in Crypto we have a ground to do better than those that we perceive as governing us.
