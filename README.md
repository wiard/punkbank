# Bitmappunk's World: A Simplified Metaverse Solution

In Bitmappunk's World, the utilization of easy-to-read code provided by `.element` presents a solution for effective parcel management on Bitmaps.

## Challenges in the Bitmap Metaverse World

The introduction of NATs proposed by BlockRunner has led to an interesting confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World and I prefer to call it a 'Frictious Moment with Great Possibilities'. Simultaneously, a second Conflict of Interest is occurring in Ordinals World. Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are experiencing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based ecosystems. On top of that, Outside Forces still are critisizing Bitcoin Ordinals as a project endangering the Bitcoin Success. The challenges I want to address are the 1) possible division in the Bitmaps Ecosystem due to BlockRunner's distinct marketing of its Metaverse Concept and 2) the critical role of indexers in both Metaverses, influencing the perception of an independent and free metaverse.

## Bitmappunk's Simplified Solution

Grounded in a theory encompassing ALL MATTER, Bitmappunk offers a simplified solution:

### Addressing NAT Theory

- Specific NAT inscriptions are suggested. 
- Advocacy for the user-friendly Sats Names initiative for Metaverse entry.
- Proposing the inscription of NATs through Sats Names, departing from the developer-oriented JSON format.

### Bitmap Enhancement

- Acknowledging the success of Bitmaps.
- Introducing a higher element, `.object` or `.element`, for advanced reasoning, incorporated within Sats Names.

### Simplified Integration

- Prioritizing readability and accessibility for all users.
- Implementing an off-chain approach for efficient indexing, mitigating Bitcoin Mempool congestion.

### PunkBank Integration

- Proposing Parcel Theory: BRC20 Tokens minted on each parcel within a Matrix.
- Envisaging vertical integration of Economies within the PunkBank Parcel Theory.

# Bitmappunk's Metaverse Proposal Summary, a solution for Mempool Clogging

The introduction of NATs by BlockRunner has introduced friction in the Bitmap Metaverse World, concurrently with Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin facing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory encompassing ALL MATTER, presents a simplified solution by introducing Reasoning on Ordinals and utilizing an Off-Chain approach.
