# 3. Developing Usecases on Disputes Resolution with Bitmaps

In this guide, we'll explore how to develop use cases for resolving disputes between people using Bitmaps. The concept involves individuals putting their stake on a Bitmap by placing collateral money on parcels owned within a community. This community rents these parcels and receives rewards for the disputes that are 'fought out' on Bitmaps. The core idea is to use collateral to demonstrate commitment to a case, and once resolved, the invested money is used to compensate the algorithm that provided the solution.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Bitmap Stake and Collateral:

- **Bitmaps as Dispute Arenas:**
  Individuals stake their claim on Bitmaps, turning them into virtual arenas for dispute resolution.

- **Collateral on Parcels:**
  Collateral money is placed on specific parcels within the Bitmap. This serves as a commitment to actively participate in dispute resolution.

### 2. Community Rental and Rewards:

- **Parcels Owned by Community:**
  The community owns and rents parcels on the Bitmap. These become the battlegrounds for disputes.

- **Rewards for Dispute Resolution:**
  The community receives rewards for successfully resolving disputes on the Bitmap. This creates an incentive for active participation.

### 3. Algorithmic Solution and Compensation:

- **Algorithmic Dispute Resolution:**
  Disputes are 'fought out' on Bitmaps through algorithmic solutions, leveraging the collective intelligence of the community.

- **Compensation from Staked Collateral:**
  Once a dispute is resolved, the money staked as collateral is used to compensate the algorithm that contributed to the solution. This aligns incentives and rewards effective dispute resolution.

## Development Steps:

1. **Define Dispute Scenarios:**
   Identify the types of disputes that can be resolved using Bitmaps. Consider real-world cases where algorithmic solutions can provide value.

2. **Bitmap Staking Mechanism:**
   Establish a mechanism for individuals to stake their claim on Bitmaps. This could involve a smart contract that manages the collateral.

3. **Community Parcel Ownership:**
   Implement a system where the community owns and rents parcels on the Bitmap. Define the criteria for parcel ownership and rental rewards.

4. **Algorithmic Dispute Resolution:**
   Develop algorithms or leverage existing solutions for dispute resolution. Ensure transparency and fairness in the resolution process.

5. **Compensation Mechanism:**
   Create a mechanism to automatically compensate the algorithm that contributed to resolving a dispute. Define how the staked collateral is distributed.

6. **Testing and Iteration:**
   Test the system with simulated disputes and iterate based on feedback. Ensure that the incentive structure aligns with effective dispute resolution.

## Conclusion:

Developing use cases for disputes resolution with Bitmaps involves a combination of stakeholder engagement, community incentives, and algorithmic solutions. This approach not only provides a unique mechanism for resolving conflicts but also fosters community collaboration and innovation.
