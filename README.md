# Bitmappunk's World: A Simplified Metaverse Solution

People LOVE numbers and people LOVE to give each other presents. Thats why we from punkbank.bitmap have chosen this opportunity to create a smaller and happier world on Bitcoin. Why would this be a clever idea. In order to experiment with concepts from Artificial Intelligence in combination with Value Transaction using the Blockchain is a very worthwhile experiment. It shows the Synthetic Economies working with Artificial Intelligence in a Laboratory Kind of way and because Code is considered Law the compexity of Smart Contract Like ways of working can be investigated thoroughly.

The present we want to give the partakers of our initiative is the possibilities to use numbers in a clever way. Besides the cleverness of using numbers, we want to do this in settings that are easy to understand for even young people, who see the online world and tokenization as the natural way to move around.

In Bitmappunk's World, the utilization of easy-to-read code provided by `.element` presents a solution for effective parcel management on Bitmaps.

But now first, the $ECH-token. With Echelon.eth (on Twitter [echelon.eth](https://twitter.com/@html_eth)) we discussed the possibilities to deploy the $ECH token on BRC20 Ordinals with 
[Unisat](https://unisat.io), the BEST online Marketplace for BRC20 tokens and Ordinals.

## Challenges in the Bitmap Metaverse World

The introduction of NATs proposed by BlockRunner has led to an interesting confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World and I prefer to call it a 'Frictious Moment with Great Possibilities'. Simultaneously, a second Conflict of Interest is occurring in Ordinals World. Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are experiencing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based ecosystems. On top of that, Outside Forces still are critisizing Bitcoin Ordinals as a project endangering the Bitcoin Success. These three major challenges are too big for me alone to address so I want to make an example to solve two major cases, the confusion between Bitmaps and the Blockrunner. With this I think I solve all.  With this effort creating a better world for all. 

## Bitmappunk's Simplified Solution

Grounded in a theory encompassing ALL MATTER, Bitmappunk offers a simplified solution by addressing NAT Theory through specific inscriptions, advocating for the user-friendly Sats Names initiative for Metaverse entry, and proposing the inscription of NATs through Sats Names, departing from the developer-oriented JSON format. In Bitmap Enhancement, Bitmappunk acknowledges the success of Bitmaps and introduces a higher element, `.object` or `.element`, for advanced reasoning, also incorporated within Sats Names. The solution prioritizes Simplified Integration by focusing on readability and accessibility for all users, along with implementing an off-chain approach for efficient indexing to mitigate Bitcoin Mempool congestion. In PunkBank Integration, Bitmappunk proposes Parcel Theory, suggesting the minting of BRC20 Tokens on each parcel within a Matrix and envisioning vertical integration of Economies within the PunkBank Parcel Theory.

# Bitmappunk's Metaverse Proposal Summary, a solution for Mempool Clogging

The introduction of NATs by BlockRunner has introduced friction in the Bitmap Metaverse World, concurrently with Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin facing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory encompassing ALL MATTER, presents a simplified solution by introducing Reasoning on Ordinals and utilizing an Off-Chain approach.
