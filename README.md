# The .... parcel.bitmap.object or parcel.bitmap.element
These are the pieces of diamond code that will survive for thousands of years on the parcel.district.bitmap.object world.

# Bitmappunk's World: A Simplified Metaverse Solution

In Bitmappunk's World, the utilization of easy-to-read code provided by `.element` presents a solution for effective parcel management on Bitmaps.

## Challenges in the Bitmap Metaverse World

The introduction of NATs proposed by BlockRunner has led to an interesting confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World and I prefer to call it a 'Frictious Moment with Great Possibilities'. Simultaneously, a second Conflict of Interest is occurring in Ordinals World. Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are experiencing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based ecosystems. On top of that, Outside Forces still are critisizing Bitcoin Ordinals as a project endangering the Bitcoin Success. These three major challenges are too big for me alone to address so I want to make an example to solve two major cases, the confusion between Bimaps and the Blockrunner. With this I think I solve all.  With this effort creating a better world for all. 

## Bitmappunk's Simplified Solution

Grounded in a theory encompassing ALL MATTER, Bitmappunk offers a simplified solution by addressing NAT Theory through specific inscriptions, advocating for the user-friendly Sats Names initiative for Metaverse entry, and proposing the inscription of NATs through Sats Names, departing from the developer-oriented JSON format. In Bitmap Enhancement, Bitmappunk acknowledges the success of Bitmaps and introduces a higher element, `.object` or `.element`, for advanced reasoning, also incorporated within Sats Names. The solution prioritizes Simplified Integration by focusing on readability and accessibility for all users, along with implementing an off-chain approach for efficient indexing to mitigate Bitcoin Mempool congestion. In PunkBank Integration, Bitmappunk proposes Parcel Theory, suggesting the minting of BRC20 Tokens on each parcel within a Matrix and envisioning vertical integration of Economies within the PunkBank Parcel Theory.

# Bitmappunk's Metaverse Proposal Summary, a solution for Mempool Clogging

The introduction of NATs by BlockRunner has introduced friction in the Bitmap Metaverse World, concurrently with Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin facing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory encompassing ALL MATTER, presents a simplified solution by introducing Reasoning on Ordinals and utilizing an Off-Chain approach.
