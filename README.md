In the vast expanse of the Bitcoin universe, a peculiar yet fascinating phenomenon unfolds, where Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) transform into flying saucers, piloted by an eclectic group of entities known as psychots. This is the story of the Bitcoin world, a place where the rules of physics are bent by the sheer force of cryptography and digital innovation.

### The Flight of the Psychots

The psychots are not your ordinary pilots; they are the guardians of value, navigating through the cryptographic sky with their flying saucers, each carrying valuable Bitcoin cargo. These saucers, visible only to those who understand the language of the blockchain, zip and zoom through the network, executing transactions with precision and flair.

### The Mission

Their mission is simple yet vital: to ensure the seamless transfer of value from one corner of the Bitcoin universe to another. Each psychot is in possession of a unique set of keys, granting them the ability to unlock their saucer's potential and spend the UTXOs they guard. The keys are not just tools but symbols of trust and power in this digital realm.

### The Journey

When a psychot decides to transfer value, they chart a course through the complex cryptographic space, initiating a sequence that would baffle most. The saucer takes off, leaving behind a trail of digital signatures and public keys, moving towards its destination with unerring accuracy. Upon reaching the target, the saucer lands, transferring its cargo of Bitcoin to the new coordinates, thus completing the transaction.

### The Transformation

But the journey does not end there. Upon the completion of a transaction, the once-spent UTXO saucer is decommissioned, its essence transformed into new UTXOs, ready to be claimed by other psychots. These new saucers, each with their cargo of Bitcoin, wait in the cryptographic hangar, ready for their next adventure.

### The Ledger

The entire saga of each saucer's flight is etched into the immutable ledger of the blockchain, a testament to the psychots' endeavors. This ledger is not just a record but a map of the universe, charting every twist and turn, every ascent and descent of the saucers through the Bitcoin cosmos.

### The Challenge

Yet, navigating the Bitcoin universe is not without its challenges. The psychots face obstacles, from the scaling limits of space to the turbulence of market forces. But with each challenge, they adapt, finding new ways to scale the heights of the blockchain, ensuring the continuity and security of their missions.

### The Harmony

In this world, psychots and their saucers coexist in a delicate balance, a dance of cryptography and digital wizardry that powers the Bitcoin network. They are the unsung heroes of this digital age, guardians of a new frontier where value knows no bounds, and transactions are as free as the psychots themselves.

### The Legacy

As the Bitcoin universe expands, the tales of the psychots and their flying saucers will continue to inspire. They are a vivid reminder of the power of innovation, the importance of security, and the boundless potential of a world built on the principles of decentralization and trust.

# An example of Using the ECH Matrix.

To work with Bitmaps is to see a simple surface mirroring the Bitcoin Blocks. The main interest or subject of Bitmap is the surface and the parcels that represent transactions on the original Bitcoin. This parcel-idea is implemented on Bitmap as a way to have boxes on this Bitmap surface and with parcels one can do a lot. 
First of all: the parcels are a subset of the Bitmap as the transaction is a child from the Bitcoin Block. The parcel being a box or a subset from the Bitmap means one can use these parcel for several goals. One of those is to put a number, a word or a treasure in the box.

# Dynamic Inscriptions on the Rock 

BRC20 tokens by @domodata made it possible to inscribe anything you want on the Bitcoin. People inscribed anything they wanted and with that creating typical crypto related names like 'pepe' and 'shitcoin'. Which is very nice but not a predicatablew world to reason upon. 

For that matter I came up with the idea to build a small indexer based on what, to me, are the important and most entertaining people in the space. I want to write down the history instead of following the hype. Following the hype means forgetting we are here to build a future together.

# The edges and vectors in the space 

With the introduction of NATs by the Blockrunner there was some hope that a better approach would become possible. A way to reason upon Bitmap as a way to reason on surfaces. Making new surfaces and by that collecting parcels from different Bitmaps and having new combinations involved. For example, parcels from different Bitmap owners on one NAT surface. Would that become possible a world would open up for people to unite efforts on a comprehensible vision as Bitmaps.

Nats was originally added to reason upon surfaces like Bitmaps but than it started to go off on its own.

## The amazing success of a simple idea

Doing Inscriptions on Bitcoin with the Ordinals of Casey @rodarmor opens up the understanding of the Bitcoin for more people and this is good for Bitcoin adoption. Since the inception of Ordinals many people have inscribed their personal art and ideas on Bitcoin and one of those is Bitmaps. 
When NATs came I decided to have my own coin, called ECH, because I saw a real flaw in Bitmap, NATs and Ordinals. All three have no coin, or token that fuels the action on their projects and with that all of these projects risk to be taken over by other initiatives that make an equal amount of noise. Besides that I want to have an independent reasoning layer with a limmited set of added variables. So I had the 3x3 Matrix with its 1-9 numbers and the a-z Alphabet. What we do with the zero, we will decide later.

Note: Without a token there is no responsibility. Anyone with a good story can come in and use Ordinals, Bitmaps or NATs for their own good. In the end this will bring serious problems to these different inititiatives.

## The challenge of Indexing

One of the results of a project like Bitmap or NATs is that they have become dependent of the Indexer to enable their project. This looks like a good option when you are befriended by those that run the indexer, but what if the team on the indexer is to busy to accept your project to their effort. You are left out and the ones with earlier access to the Ordinals Indexer has an advantage above the newcomers. Which, in the end, stalls true innovation. The new environment on Ordinals presumes innovation but in fact it stops innovation on its theory.

## Now with ECH

The project of ECH started, just like many other projects, as an experiment. I was looking for months at what happened on Bitmap and to my surprise, many developers came in with interesting ideas but no one really came with a new vision on Parcels. 

In the beginning I talked with many people within the Bitmap community and I shared many ideas. The general feeling was that parcels needed to be addressed as a topic and we spoke about some solutions. One of those was to use parcels as a stablecoin, because there are so many.

Just like anybody else I was in kind of a tunnelvision though where it seemed to be impossible to reason out of Bitmaps and have a wider world built on the same Bitcoin data as the Bitmaps were using. When the Blockrunner came with NATs I felt free to create my own matrices that were my type of Bitmaps but on a totally differnt principle. My Matrices are derived from Parcels and were a way to give some usability to parcels by having them close together on one bitmap. In a strict format. A 3x3 Matrix.

## The Matrix

This very old idea that we are all caught up in the Matrix is fro a movie that we all know. To me the Matrix is a surface, just like Bitmaps, but now just for the use of simple calculations. Just like parcels on Bitmaps can be filled with numbers and other inscriptions, so can the squares of my Matrix be filled with Inscriptions that are to be used for calculations. Calculations of all kinds that are be looked into later. 
Main thing is that a Matrix is simpler than an endless number of parcel spread around on more than 800.000 bitmaps and a Matrix is very much used in Science and even in history by Chinese Army theorists.

## How to go on from now

Once Inscriptions are seen as a better way to build a Trustless Web, the organization of these Inscriptions can be seen in a different light. In fact everything organized on Ordinals can be re-adjusted for a better usecase. Ordinals can stay as it is now, being a secure provider of an Inscription Layer on Bitcoin, but the approach of new initiatves will become more centered of having a vision why we would need Inscriptions in the first place. 
For a start its nice that people use Inscriptions to scratch the Rock that they love so much, but a movement towards meainingfulness on the same Bitcoin, is certainly the next phase. Things can get pretty boring with all the Cats, Geeze and useless names on Bitcoin.

## Now with Matrices and other things

Besides the use of Matrices as surfaces to put Inscriptions on there needs to come another approach on Inscriptions and this is the re-use of Inscriptions that have some meaning. Not just for saving energy and inscription fees but most of all to give new comers on Ordinals Theory some sense of direction, instead of just being there for the pump of the next token or coin .

Thats why simpe constructions of words are needed. Words that are put together in a simple format and that express together more than each of these words individually. Thats why the word-constructs of ECH are called Word Triangles. These are words that together form some added meaning such that communities are able to build ideas around carefully choses words. When a word-construct is addopted by a community it becomes easier to create new collections within these word constructs. 



# True innovation is the peer to peer trade of value

As the situation is now the people who are first on Ordinals have taken in their positions to have circles created around them that decide for the narratives that are carried by the larger community. This means that newcomers have to adapt themselves to the rules of the people who are already there. And this is not a fair ground for addoption of the Trustless Web and the understanding of what this new technology could mean for people.

We as early adaptors or adopters of Ordinals Theory we have the duty to come up with a framework that is user friendly for the newcomers in this complicated landscape and the future generations that will come in this space.
