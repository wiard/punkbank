# Bitmappunk's World: A Simplified Metaverse Solution

To work with Bitmaps is to see a simple surface mirroring the Bitcoin Blocks. The main interest or subject of Bitmap is the surface and the parcels that represent transactions on the original Bitcoin. This parcel-idea is implemented on Bitmap as a way to have boxes on this Bitmap surface and with parcels one can do a lot. 
First of all: the parcels are a subset of the Bitmap as the transaction is a child from the Bitcoin Block. The parcel being a box or a subset from the Bitmap means one can use these parcel for several goals. One of those is to put a number, a word or a treasure in the box.

One of the problems with Bitmap though is that bij implementing it as the only world on Bitcoin one can not reason on Bitmaps like one would do on other surfaces in the normal world. Thats why nobody came yet upon the plan to have these parcels used in een different surface, apart from Bitmap.

With the introduction of NATs by the Blockrunner there was some hope that a better approach would become possible. A way to reason upon Bitmap as a way to reason on surfaces. Making new surfaces and by that collecting parcels from different Bitmaps and having new combinations involved. For example, parcels from different Bitmap owners on one NAT surface. Would that become possible a world would open up for people to unite efforts on a comprehensible vision as Bitmaps.

To state this basic vision again: Bitmap is a good way to represent Bitcoin as a surface to do development on. It's a very clear structure of an apporach that speaks to the larger amount of people that have no developers experience.

## The amazing success of a simple idea

Doing Inscriptions on Bitcoin with the Ordinals of Casey Rodarmor opens up the understanding of the Bitcoin for more people and this is good for Bitcoin adoption. Since the inception of Ordinals many people have inscribed their personal art and ideas on Bitcoin and one of those is Bitmaps. 
When NATs came I decided to try my own coin, called ECH, because I saw a real flaw in Bitmap, NATs and Ordinals. All three have no coin, or token that fuels the action on their projects and with that all of these projects risk to be taken over by initiatives that create a lot of noise. 

Without a token there is no responibility. Anyone with a good story can come in and use Ordinals, Bitmaps or NATs for their own good. In the end this will bring serious problems to these different inititiatives.

One of the results of a project like Bitmap or NATs is that they have become dependent of the Indexer to enable their project. This looks like a good option when you are befriended by those that run the indexer, but what if the team on the indexer is to busy to accept your project to their effort. You are left out and the ones with earlier access to the Ordinals Indexer has an advantage above the newcomers. Which, in the end, stalls true innovation. The new environment on Ordinals presumes innovation but in fact it stops innovation on its theory.

## Now with ECH

The project of ECH started, just like many other projects, as an experiment. I was looking for months at what happened on Bitmap and to my surprise, many developers came in with interesting ideas but no one really came with a new vision on Parcels. 

In the beginning I talked with many people within the Bitmap community and I shared many ideas. The general feeling was that parcels needed to be addressed as a topic and we spoke about some solutions. One of those was to use parcels as a stablecoin, because there are so many.

Just like anybody else I was in kind of a tunnelvision though where it seemed to be impossible to reason out of Bitmaps and have a wider world built on the same Bitcoin data as the Bitmaps were using. When the Blockrunner came with NATs I felt free to create my own matrices that were my type of Bitmaps but on a totally differnt principle. My Matrices are derived from Parcels and were a way to give some usability to parcels by having them close together on one bitmap. In a strict format. A 3x3 Matrix.

## The Matrix

This very old idea that we are all caught up in the Matrix is fro a movie that we all know. To me the Matrix is a surface, just like Bitmaps, but now just for the use of simple calculations. Just like parcels on Bitmaps can be filled with numbers and other inscriptions, so can the squares of my Matrix be filled with Inscriptions that are to be used for calculations. Calculations of all kinds that are be looked into later. 
Main thing is that a Matrix is simpler than an endless number of parcel spread around on more than 800.000 bitmaps and a Matrix is very much used in Science and even in history by Chinese Army theorists.

## How to go on from now

Of coarse i cannot do all this on my own and I need to build a community that tries all these amazing ideas out. The fractionlized ownership, the encrypted vault on Bitcoin. All these ideas have to be tried out in the community and be organized in a way that people feel the need to stay committed and to continue to innovate. This will only work when one sees the value of the $ech coin climb as well as the inventions that one is able to make woth this simple subject, the 3x3 Matrix on Bitmap.
Bitmap is a proven success. Parceling needs to become a success and the Digital Matter Theory of the BlockRunner also needs to be connected with the Parceling because it enables different communities to work on the same solution and this is a multifunctional Metaverse where reasoning on Words and Numbers is an absolute necessity. With this simple way of implementing Reasoning on Words and Numbers we have cerated a laboratory for experimenting with Artificial Intelligence in a pleasant and Fun way and even creating value with it. Because all thesde number and Words can be configured in ways that people want to start to collect them. 

## What I foresee with my Matrix on Bitmap

My wish is to see people of all cultures and all walks of life to work together in a way that is profitabe and encouraging for us all. I believe that with Technology like Bitcoin and Artificial Intelligence, we have entered the ages of Abundance. We have enough mental and physical resources to live in a peaceful and good way with everyone on our beautiful planet. The only thing we need to decide is that we WANT to create a united wolrd. 
And this has become possible by combining Bitmap Theory, Digital Matter Theory and my Matrix Theory all in one. And build it together on our beloved Bitcoin.

# The unexpected advantages of this simplified world built on Bitcoin

Grounded in a theory encompassing ALL MATTER, Bitmappunk offers a simplified solution by addressing NAT Theory through specific inscriptions, advocating for the user-friendly Sats Names initiative for Metaverse entry, and proposing the inscription of NATs through Sats Names, departing from the developer-oriented JSON format. In Bitmap Enhancement, Bitmappunk acknowledges the success of Bitmaps and introduces a higher element, `.object` or `.element`, for advanced reasoning, also incorporated within Sats Names. The solution prioritizes Simplified Integration by focusing on readability and accessibility for all users, along with implementing an off-chain approach for efficient indexing to mitigate Bitcoin Mempool congestion. In PunkBank Integration, Bitmappunk proposes Parcel Theory, suggesting the minting of BRC20 Tokens on each parcel within a Matrix and envisioning vertical integration of Economies within the PunkBank Parcel Theory.

The introduction of NATs by BlockRunner has introduced friction in the Bitmap Metaverse World, concurrently with Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin facing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory encompassing ALL MATTER, presents a simplified solution by introducing Reasoning on Ordinals and utilizing an Off-Chain approach.
