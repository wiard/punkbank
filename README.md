# Bitmappunk's World: A Simplified Metaverse Solution

In Bitmappunk's World, the utilization of easy-to-read code provided by `.element` presents a solution for effective parcel management on Bitmaps.

## Challenges in the Bitmap Metaverse World

The introduction of NATs proposed by BlockRunner has led to confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World. Concurrently, Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are experiencing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based ecosystems. These challenges include a division in the Bitmaps Ecosystem due to BlockRunner's marketing of its Metaverse Concept as distinct, and the vital role of indexers in both Metaverses, impacting the vision of an independent and free metaverse.

## Bitmappunk's Simplified Solution

As a brand grounded in a theory encompassing ALL MATTER, Bitmappunk proposes a simplified solution:

### Addressing NAT Theory

- Using particular NAT inscriptions.
- Advocating the user-friendly Sats Names initiative for Metaverse entry.
- Inscribing NATs through Sats Names instead of the developer-oriented JSON format.

### Bitmap Enhancement

- Acknowledging Bitmaps' success.
- Introducing a higher element, `.object` or `.element`, for advanced reasoning, inscribed in Sats Names.

### Simplified Integration

- Improving readability and accessibility for all users.
- Off-chain implementation for efficient indexing, preventing Bitcoin Mempool congestion.

## Ongoing Development

The proposed solution is depicted in the images above, and continuous work is underway to refine and implement it.

# Bitmappunk's Metaverse Proposal Summary

The introduction of NATs by BlockRunner has caused an interesting friction in the Bitmap Metaverse World, and at the same time Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are clogging, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory employing ALL MATTER, offers a simpler solution.

### NATs Simplification

- Attaching NAT inscriptions to Semantic Concepts that show direct entry to an object within Bitmap Theory.
- Advocating the Sats Names initiative for user-friendly Metaverse entry.

### Bitmap Enhancement

- Acknowledging Bitmaps' success.
- Introducing a higher element, ".object," or ".element" for advanced reasoning, inscribed in Sats Names.

### Simplified Integration

- Improving readability and accessibility for all users.
- Off-chain implementation to enhance efficiency and prevent Bitcoin Mempool congestion.

### PunkBank Integration

- Parcel Theory: BRC20 Tokens minted on each parcel within a Matrix.
- Vertical integration of Economies within the PunkBank Parcel Theory.

## Bitmappunk's Solution for Mempool Clogging

Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are clogging, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory employing ALL MATTER, offers a simpler solution by introducing Reasoning on Ordinals and this Off-Chain.
