# Umeko's World: A Tale of Parcels on Bitmaps reasoned upon with NATs


With the coming of NAT's proposed by the BockRunner, there has come confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World.
Att the same time Mempools of Ordinals on Bitcoin are clogging. These both events are worrying for the Eco Systems built on Bitcoin for several reasons: first, there has come division in the Bitmaps Ecosystem, because of the way the BlockRunner has marketed its new Metverse Concept as one thats better than the Bitmap Metverse. Second, the indexers in bothe Metverses play a role that has become too vital for participators to expect an independent and free metaverse for the long run.

We, Umeko, as a Brand on the Metverse that is embodied by a Theory that employs ALL MATTER, we propose a solution thats is simpler in all aspects.

The first proposals concerns the NAT theory that has very complicated ways of inscribing and therefor use unfriendly as a way to enter a free Metaverse for all. 
We have earlier seen taht an initiative like Sats Names had developed an easy to understand method to give names to person, objects, elements in the Metaverse. This is the method we propose as well in this way: NATs by the BlockRunner porposes .element as the basic element of their Metaverse and thats what we agree with as well but we want to inscribe it on Sats Names instead of inscribing it in JSON format, which is for developers and not for users that want comprehensible access to the Metverse.

Than, with Bitmaps, we have acknowledhge, its highly successful as it is right now. It is widely accepted as a way to build a Metverse for the long term.
