# Bitmappunk's World: A Simplified Metaverse Solution

People LOVE numbers and people LOVE to work together when the goal is set. Thats why we from `punkbank.bitmap` have chosen this opportunity to create a smaller and happier world on Bitcoin. We do this with a clever idea, creating more simplicity on ideas that already worked. Bitmap Theory of Bitoshi Blockamoto has resulted in an amazing pace of adoption. It did adopt so fast because the people from all walks of life and from any culture or country understood the concept right away. Building a Digital World on a Programmable Solution, the amazing Bitcoin. This concept of a genius, Satoshi Nakamoto, has set many many new ideas in movement. Even whole economies are being built on Bitcoin and other chains that soon have started following this amazing vision, a Trustless Digital Economy where tokens are built in as keepers of trust and innovation. 

As the Bitcoin is a very simple and straightforward solution to have better ways of people transacting what is of value to them, I envision that the biggest value to us all is how we work together on the available knowledge in order to create a better world. In my mind the same question has always arisen: why can't we work together in such a way that we find common causes and common goals and work from there to create better circumstances for all. 
The great invention of Bitcoin and its implication for creating an unbreakable economy that people can trust stroke me immediatly as a clever solution, esecially when I saw applications coming that involved real world use cases that were solved with the blockchain and the tokens that were used to secure the blockchain and its transactions.

Building Virtual Worlds with Non- Arbitrary Data derived from the Bitcoin, envisioned by Bitoshu Blockamoto in March 2023 not only enlightened me to create new things based on this onbreakable bitcoin, many many people came to this idea and Bitmap Theory resulted in real world but digital use cases.
What the world needs next, I said to myself is a world based on words that can be reasoned upon. I came up this idea because, just like Bitmap, words and even sentences could be inscribed on Bitcoin with the Ordinal Theory given to us by Casey Rodarmor. With the opportunity for inscribing words on Bitcoin, people saw that we could make words immortal on the Unbreakable Valuechain Bitcoin.

The next step is now to reason on these words and this is based on the concept of the Semantic Web that was invented a long time ago by the same man who invented the internet, Tim Berners Lee, but it never fell into the eye of the larger public. Bitcoin was slowly accepted by the larger population and Bitmap even very fast. For Bitmap being accepted by a wide group of people it took like a month. 
This amazing event opened my mind and made me decide to join the Bitmap Community and even open an account on X with my own unique and inscribedon Bitcoin name, brc20punk. After that I started communicating wit the Bitmap Community and offering ideas that one could do with Bitmap. 
What I saw was that people had many ideas to build on Bitmap and most of the ideas were images. Immediatly after the imgaes that were being traded on the brc20-standard came the 3D all immersive game that people went into and started developing.
Still the use of words that, in my vision, needed to start working by having layers of reasoning upon, were missing.

Another very important aspect that was not being adopted by the people who loved the Bitmap as a surface, was the parcel on the bitmap. The parcel represents the Transaction, in Bitoshi Blockamoto's theory and therefor, I felt, this parcel needs to become the value of Bitmap. I came up with several ideas for these parcel. Like giving them for free to the people who owned bitmaps, or to create a Stablecoin on the total collection of parcels. It seemed all to comlicated though and people were not accepting this idea of mine.

"I have to start something oin my own," I slowly realized and I met this youg man, called Echelon on X who expressed the same vision as me, that words were very important in the virtual world, because they provide instant meaning to people and they make it easier for evryone to understand what is ment or who we need to look for when its a certain subjet concerned. Another person who also shared the same idea about words was HopefulofNFT. 
Combined with parcel I decided to create my own coin and use this coin to first, empower people to parcel on their Bitmaps and parcel these in a sepecific format that everyone understands: in the form of a 3x3 Matrix. Everyone loves a simple form as a matrix and what come extra to this, one can put numbers in this 9 places of the Matrix. The numbers 1-9. 

And a great idea was born!

Numbering will unite all people of the world because everyone on this planet loves numbering and everyone on this planet loves simple geometrical forms. This is in every culture and with every human being the same.

The next big step is to understand what one can do with these 9 numbers and right away, after my $ech coin was minted out in just a few hours, I realized that people all over the world were thinking exactly the same as I. Number on a matrix on Bitmap are an excellent idea to try all kinds of use cases out. People even strated providing me with ideas.

The ideas were: Fractionelized ownership can be realized with this 3x3 Matrix. The person who gave me this idea said: "We can digitally cut a Lamborghini in 9 equal pieces and spread them over your Matrix."
ANother person said: "We can use these 9 placeholders of the Matrix to encrypt a vault on Bitcoin and have a contest who can break the code. We can even mine Bitmaps with that or other constructs."

To summarize all this: we can do anything with a simple matrix on made of Parcels on Bitmap and reason in any way to explore our knowledge and have a exciting way of working together and finding communality in achieving knowledge in a fun way.

and In order to experiment with concepts from Artificial Intelligence in combination with Value Transaction using the Blockchain is a very worthwhile experiment. It shows the Synthetic Economies working with Artificial Intelligence in a Laboratory Kind of way and because Code is considered Law the complexity of Smart Contract Like ways of working can be investigated thoroughly.

The presents we want to give the partakers of our initiative is the possibilities to use numbers in a clever way. Besides the cleverness of using numbers, we want to do this in settings that are easy to understand for even young people, who see the online world and tokenization as the natural way to move around.

In Bitmappunk's World, the utilization of easy-to-read code provided by `.element` presents a solution for effective parcel management on Bitmaps.

But now first, the $ECH-token. With Echelon.eth (on Twitter [echelon.eth](https://twitter.com/@html_eth)) we discussed the possibilities to deploy the $ECH token on BRC20 Ordinals with 
[Unisat](https://unisat.io), the BEST online Marketplace for BRC20 tokens and Ordinals.

## Challenges in the Bitmap Metaverse World

The introduction of NATs proposed by BlockRunner has led to an interesting confusion in the Bitmap Metaverse World and I prefer to call it a 'Frictious Moment with Great Possibilities'. Simultaneously, a second Conflict of Interest is occurring in Ordinals World. Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin are experiencing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based ecosystems. On top of that, Outside Forces still are critisizing Bitcoin Ordinals as a project endangering the Bitcoin Success. These three major challenges are too big for me alone to address so I want to make an example to solve two major cases, the confusion between Bitmaps and the Blockrunner. With this I think I solve all.  With this effort creating a better world for all. 

## Bitmappunk's Simplified Solution

Grounded in a theory encompassing ALL MATTER, Bitmappunk offers a simplified solution by addressing NAT Theory through specific inscriptions, advocating for the user-friendly Sats Names initiative for Metaverse entry, and proposing the inscription of NATs through Sats Names, departing from the developer-oriented JSON format. In Bitmap Enhancement, Bitmappunk acknowledges the success of Bitmaps and introduces a higher element, `.object` or `.element`, for advanced reasoning, also incorporated within Sats Names. The solution prioritizes Simplified Integration by focusing on readability and accessibility for all users, along with implementing an off-chain approach for efficient indexing to mitigate Bitcoin Mempool congestion. In PunkBank Integration, Bitmappunk proposes Parcel Theory, suggesting the minting of BRC20 Tokens on each parcel within a Matrix and envisioning vertical integration of Economies within the PunkBank Parcel Theory.

# Bitmappunk's Metaverse Proposal Summary, a solution for Mempool Clogging

The introduction of NATs by BlockRunner has introduced friction in the Bitmap Metaverse World, concurrently with Ordinal Mempools on Bitcoin facing congestion, raising concerns for Bitcoin-based Eco Systems. Bitmappunk, embodying a Metaverse theory encompassing ALL MATTER, presents a simplified solution by introducing Reasoning on Ordinals and utilizing an Off-Chain approach.
