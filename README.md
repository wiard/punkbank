# Dynamic Inscriptions on the Rock 

To work with Bitmaps is to see a simple surface mirroring the Bitcoin Blocks. The main interest or subject of Bitmap is the surface and the parcels that represent transactions on the original Bitcoin. This parcel-idea is implemented on Bitmap as a way to have boxes on this Bitmap surface and with parcels one can do a lot. 
First of all: the parcels are a subset of the Bitmap as the transaction is a child from the Bitcoin Block. The parcel being a box or a subset from the Bitmap means one can use these parcel for several goals. One of those is to put a number, a word or a treasure in the box.

One of the problems with Bitmap though is that bij implementing it as the only world on Bitcoin one can not reason on Bitmaps like one would do on other surfaces in the normal world. Thats why nobody came yet upon the plan to have these parcels used in een different surface, apart from Bitmap.

With the introduction of NATs by the Blockrunner there was some hope that a better approach would become possible. A way to reason upon Bitmap as a way to reason on surfaces. Making new surfaces and by that collecting parcels from different Bitmaps and having new combinations involved. For example, parcels from different Bitmap owners on one NAT surface. Would that become possible a world would open up for people to unite efforts on a comprehensible vision as Bitmaps.

To state this basic vision again: Bitmap is a good way to represent Bitcoin as a surface to do development on. It's a very clear structure of an apporach that speaks to the larger amount of people that have no developers experience.

## The amazing success of a simple idea

Doing Inscriptions on Bitcoin with the Ordinals of Casey Rodarmor opens up the understanding of the Bitcoin for more people and this is good for Bitcoin adoption. Since the inception of Ordinals many people have inscribed their personal art and ideas on Bitcoin and one of those is Bitmaps. 
When NATs came I decided to try my own coin, called ECH, because I saw a real flaw in Bitmap, NATs and Ordinals. All three have no coin, or token that fuels the action on their projects and with that all of these projects risk to be taken over by initiatives that create a lot of noise. 

Without a token there is no responibility. Anyone with a good story can come in and use Ordinals, Bitmaps or NATs for their own good. In the end this will bring serious problems to these different inititiatives.

One of the results of a project like Bitmap or NATs is that they have become dependent of the Indexer to enable their project. This looks like a good option when you are befriended by those that run the indexer, but what if the team on the indexer is to busy to accept your project to their effort. You are left out and the ones with earlier access to the Ordinals Indexer has an advantage above the newcomers. Which, in the end, stalls true innovation. The new environment on Ordinals presumes innovation but in fact it stops innovation on its theory.

## Now with ECH

The project of ECH started, just like many other projects, as an experiment. I was looking for months at what happened on Bitmap and to my surprise, many developers came in with interesting ideas but no one really came with a new vision on Parcels. 

In the beginning I talked with many people within the Bitmap community and I shared many ideas. The general feeling was that parcels needed to be addressed as a topic and we spoke about some solutions. One of those was to use parcels as a stablecoin, because there are so many.

Just like anybody else I was in kind of a tunnelvision though where it seemed to be impossible to reason out of Bitmaps and have a wider world built on the same Bitcoin data as the Bitmaps were using. When the Blockrunner came with NATs I felt free to create my own matrices that were my type of Bitmaps but on a totally differnt principle. My Matrices are derived from Parcels and were a way to give some usability to parcels by having them close together on one bitmap. In a strict format. A 3x3 Matrix.

## The Matrix

This very old idea that we are all caught up in the Matrix is fro a movie that we all know. To me the Matrix is a surface, just like Bitmaps, but now just for the use of simple calculations. Just like parcels on Bitmaps can be filled with numbers and other inscriptions, so can the squares of my Matrix be filled with Inscriptions that are to be used for calculations. Calculations of all kinds that are be looked into later. 
Main thing is that a Matrix is simpler than an endless number of parcel spread around on more than 800.000 bitmaps and a Matrix is very much used in Science and even in history by Chinese Army theorists.

## How to go on from now

Once Inscriptions are seen as a better way to build a Trustless Web, the organization of these Inscriptions can be seen in a different light. In fact everything organized on Ordinals can be re-adjusted for a better usecase. Ordinals can stay as it is now, being a secure provider of an Inscription Layer on Bitcoin, but the approach of new initiatves will become more centered of having a vision why we would need Inscriptions in the first place. 
For a start its nice that people use Inscriptions to scratch the Rock that they love so much, but a movement towards meainingfulness on the same Bitcoin, is certainly the next phase. Things can get pretty boring with all the Cats, Geeze and useless names on Bitcoin. 

## Now with Matrices and other things

Besides the use of Matrices as surfaces to put Inscriptions on there needs to come another approach on Inscriptions and this is the re-use of Inscriptions that have some meaning. Not just for saving energy and inscription fees but most of all to give new comers on Ordinals Theory some sense of direction, instead of just being there for the pump of the next token or coin .

Thats why simpe constructions of words are needed. Words that are put together in a simple format and that express together more than each of these words individually. Thats why the word-constructs of ECH are called Word Triangles. These are words that together form some added meaning such that communities are able to build ideas around carefully choses words. When a word-construct is addopted by a community it becomes easier to create new collections within these word constructs. 



# True innovation is the peer to peer trade of value

As the situation is now the people who are first on Ordinals have taken in their positions to have circles created around them that decide for the narratives that are carried by the larger community. This means that newcomers have to adapt themselves to the rules of the people who are already there. And this is not a fair ground for addoption of the Trustless Web and the understanding of what this new technology could mean for people.

We as early adaptors or adopters of Ordinals Theory we have the duty to come up with a framework that is user friendly for the newcomers in this complicated landscape and the future generations that will come in this space.
